# Page-flip-animation
It's a flipping page animation using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I learned it when I had to make a countdown timer which I am yet to post but it was fun to learn.
Credit to https://github.com/codingstar-jason/3D-Book-Tutorial-Basic-CodingStar for helping me learn this awesome animation.
